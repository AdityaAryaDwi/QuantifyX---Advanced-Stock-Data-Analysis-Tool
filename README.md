# QuantifyX---Advanced-Stock-Data-Analysis-Tool

Developed a comprehensive system in Java to fetch, clean, and analyze historical stock data using Alpha Vantage API.
Implemented data processing techniques to calculate key financial indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA).
Utilized JFreeChart to create visual representations of stock trends, enhancing data interpretation.
Automated report generation by integrating Apache POI for exporting analysis results to Excel.
Designed modular and reusable components, allowing seamless adaptation for analyzing other time-series data.

Project Overview 
The Java Stock Data Analysis Project is designed to fetch, process, and analyze historical 
stock data. The project uses several Java libraries to perform different tasks such as fetching 
data from an API, cleaning the data, analyzing it, visualizing it, and finally generating 
reports. The goal is to provide insightful information about stock prices and trends. 
DataFetcher Module 
**Purpose:** The DataFetcher module is responsible for connecting to the Alpha Vantage 
API to retrieve historical stock data. It sends a request to the API and stores the data locally 
for further processing.

DataCleaner Module 
**Purpose:** The DataCleaner module processes the raw data received from the API, 
converting it into a more structured and usable format. It extracts useful fields and removes 
any unnecessary information.

DataAnalyzer Module 
**Purpose:** This module analyzes the cleaned stock data. It can detect trends and calculate 
various financial indicators like the Simple Moving Average (SMA).

DataVisualizer Module 
**Purpose:** DataVisualizer uses the JFreeChart library to create line charts from the 
analyzed data. It helps in representing trends and patterns visually, which can make 
understanding the stock behavior easier.

ReportGenerator Module 
**Purpose:** The ReportGenerator module creates Excel reports of the analyzed stock data 
using Apache POI. It ensures the output data is presented in a neat and accessible format for 
sharing or further analysis.
